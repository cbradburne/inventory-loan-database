Create the folder "Database" in:

Windows - C:/Users/Public/Documents/
macOS   - Macintosh HD/Users/Shared/

The Database folder included contains example files. Copy these files to the "Databse" folder for testing.

Create your own JSON files using the included "Item CSV to JSON" and "User CSV to JSON" files and move the new JSON files to the 'Database' folder.
